					<p> In spring 2019, I led an investigation into a set of explicit, misogynistic and racist documents that an anonymous source leaked to the school paper late one Thursday night. Before the story <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/02/718969495/swarthmore-fraternities-disband-over-leaked-documents-that-detailed-misogyny"> went national</a>, we had 10 days to figure out how to verify that the documents were real and that they were, in fact, from a campus fraternity. We proved not only that the documents were written by fraternity members about fraternity events, but also that they were circulated openly among the members on a Swarthmore listserv. </p>
