											<p> At 9:15 a.m. on Tuesday, May 1, over 30 students filed into Dean of Students Liz Braun’s office on the first floor of Parrish Hall. As Braun rose from her seat, the students — members of Organizing for Survivors, a group that has protested Title IX handling at the college since early March — placed their backpacks on the floor beside them and announced their plans to stay there indefinitely. </p>

											<h2> Listeners of WAMU Project: Catherine White </h2>

											<p> Catherine White, a 17-year-old Sherwood high school senior from Olney, Maryland, started listening to WAMU with her family. Many families listen to public radio together–so many that the term “NPR babies” is in common usage. But Catherine White isn’t like any other NPR baby. Here’s why she continued to listen to WAMU, even without her family. </p>

											<h2> Brief: P.A. redistricting likely to amplify Swarthmore students’ voices in midterm election </h2>
											<span class = "image fit"><img src = "https://swarthmorephoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-07-at-10.59.41-PM-800x445.png" alt = "Map of district lines in PA district 7."/></span>
											<p> Under the 2011 Pennsylvania Congressional Redistricting Act, the Republican-majority Pa. General Assembly moved Swarthmore out of the 7th district, of which it had been a part for over 75 years, and into the 1st district, grouping it with reliably Democratic Philadelphia suburbs. Outside of a district so gerrymandered it has been nicknamed “Goofy Kicking Donald Duck,” the cutout of Swarthmore now outlines Goofy’s left arm, and at the neck of the peninsula-like shape that envelops the town, the 1st district is no wider than ½ mile.</p>
