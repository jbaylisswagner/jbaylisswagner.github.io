      <p>I am an enthusiastic writer, coder, reporter, and reader in Swarthmore's Class of 2021. </p>

      <h3>What I'm currently up to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Coding this portfolio site (because why practice self-care when you can try the same line of CSS in three different places instead?)</li>
        <li> Cooking and posting my quarantine recipes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/baylisscooks/">Instagram</a> (like everyone else you know)</li>
        <li> Interviewing students and writing about them for the <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events">Swarthmore College News & Events page</a> and the <a href="https://bulletin.swarthmore.edu/">alumni magazine</a> </li>
        <!-- <li> Starting research on the function of social connections in undergraduate programs and how they change in online learning for the <a href="https://aydelotte.swarthmore.edu/">Aydelotte Foundation</a></li>
        <li> Keeping a quarantine journal (my friend who just took a course on the Black Plague told me to keep a "plague journal," but let's just refer to it this way) </li>

        <li>Monitoring <a href="https://swarthmorephoenix.com/"><em>The Phoenix</em> website.</a> I have learned that 1) CleanTalk is the best anti-spam plugin and 2) comments need to be verified... one spam attack was enough for me. </li>
        <li>More coding (check out my GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/jbaylisswagner">here</a>!)</li>
