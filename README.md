This project started as a way for me to learn HTML and CSS and ended up as my portfolio site. I started with an HTML5UP template for the page's baseline CSS elements ([the editorial theme by @ajlkn](https://html5up.net/editorial)), which is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://html5up.net/license)) and made significant changes from there. I write the HTML of the page directly on Atom. (An upcoming goal is to automate the writing of HTML elements/ convert from markdown, because why am I typing out "<a href="" target="_blank"></a> in 2022??). I also installed Gulp.js on this project so that I could build the page automatically and keep a live server up while I develop.

Hope you enjoy, and please get in touch if you're interested in learning more about me or the site!
