            											<p> The code for this graphic game was designed entirely by me for
                                                            an assignment in my Introduction to Computer Science class.
                                                            The fish become sick at random and the player must click them
                                                             to restore them to health. </p>

            											<p> This program was designed to work with a GUI that our professor had designed.
                                                            The game resembles Catan. Worked with my partner to design main.cpp,

                                                            implement graphAlgorithms and adjacencyListUndirectedGraph-inl.h </p>

                                                            assignment (woohoo), takes single novels or corpora
                                                            of novels as input. The user can choose novels from
                                                            these files and compare them. The program displays
                                                            "most frequent words" in each novel and "most distinctive words"
                                                            in each through comparison. The program also displays the "context"
                                                            (surrounding words) of any word in the novel. (Ex: input "love" will
                                                             display every use of the word "love" in the novel). I experimented
                                                             with removing different stopwords when we returned to this program
                                                             for my English class. </p>
