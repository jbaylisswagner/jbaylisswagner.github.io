            											<p> I designed and implemented this code from scratch for

                                                             to restore them to health. </p>

            											<p> This game, which resembles Catan, was designed to work with a GUI that our professor had designed.
                                                            I worked with my partner to design main.cpp,

                                                            assignment (woohoo), takes single novels or a corpora
                                                            of novels as input. The user can choose novels from
                                                            these files and compare them. The program displays
                                                            "most frequent words" in each novel and "most distinctive words"
                                                            in each through comparison. The program also displays the "context"
                                                            (surrounding words) of any word in the novel. (Ex: input "love" will

                                                             with removing different stopwords when we returned to this program
                                                             for my English class. </p>
